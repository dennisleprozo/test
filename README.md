My personal project: DeViant clothing, an interactive user interface e-commerce web application.

Used React.js, Redux, Express, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, React Bootstrap, Fontawesome and Semantic-UI Libraries.

Worked with PostGreSQL, Heroku and SQLTabs for the Database with the help of APIs, Axios, Massive, Postman and Jest for testing.
